# Deep Learning Model for Visual Tracking

Implementation of tracker dlt using python language. Using this tracker, you can track the trajectory of an object on a set of images in real time. Get info [here:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hvNFX-P4J6BEBHWqEvr6ClUhkpQkUEK7?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. I spend my work on Linux OS, further scripts are presented to preinstall and run this program.

### Prerequisites

You need to install python3, pip and some packages.

For an individual launch of the program, you will need sets of video frames. I crawled ready-made kits on this [website](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/datasets.html).

To run the program, you need to specify the path to the set in the appropriate column: (!)

If your set is not from the above set, you will need to enter the initial parameters of the object in the program (run_individual.py) 

```


```

## Running by example

download the set Car4 to your computer ....
